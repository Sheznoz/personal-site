I've always been around computers. From an early age there were video games in our house, and it wasn't long before they were being played on a Windows Vista PC.
Truth be told I was never too curious about how it all worked -- I just wanted to blow shit up on the screen. It wasn't until the end of school I started sinking
my teeth into how it all really worked, through an Informatics class.
This is where I learned the basics of SQL and data types. I liked it. The storage of data was much more complex than I had ever suspected.

## University and Work
Right out of school I went back into school. In hindsight, I hated school, and this decision made very little sense. I studied a business degree, Information Systems,
in the interest of working as a solutions architect or something of this sort. I didn't really take to it -- too much marketing and economics -- failed a few classes, and by my third year I dropped out.
During this time I got my start as an IT professional, working Helpdesk at a primary school (God bless my cousin for getting me this gig). I only worked one day a
week, but I learned very much nonetheless. My eyes were opened to virtual machines, server management, network infrastructure, CLIs, MDM, AD...
<br>*I was hooked*.

SSHing into the various virtualized servers, fixing absolutely borked laptops via PXE-booting to the deployment server, re-building cabinets -- and of course, my
favourite, the **big** end of year imaging jobs. I thought I'd be happy in this line of work forever. However, the more I learnt from my cousin about how this
occupation worked, the less interested I became.
<br>Two words: *billable hours*
<pre>


</pre>
<br>There was no incentive to work hard. The types of issues in that line of work meant you had to take that work home. You can't bill people for work done at home.
I was mulling over all this in early 2020. What came shortly after really did not help the "stay in the consulting area?" question. I left when my
mentor did. Did some call centre work for about a year. It never stuck - I liked helping people but ultimately it wasn't engaging. It wasn't computers.

## Software is Interesting
In the year of the dead-end jobs, my cousin had moved into the logical step-up from Sys Admin: he was working as a Dev Ops engineer. The company needed Application
Support, and both myself and my brother were urged on by our cousin to apply. We thought they were only hiring one and were pleasantly surprised when we both got the
job. It was a whole different ball game to Helpdesking. I had to learn how a software stack worked, how the Azure environment hosting it worked. They were in the beta
stages of an Angular suite of web apps, but we sadly didn't get much exposure to this. Our primary concern was their older desktop app that got them started.
It was written in Delphi. And we weren't permitted to check the source code. It seemed no one was. No one was maintaining it. It was fascinating.
<pre>


</pre>
A few months in my brother had is mind set on becoming a front-end developer. I was more interested in the Dev Ops side of things. They were a bit short-staffed on
that team, so I was given some small responsibilities, and invited to the weekly team catch-up.
<br>This did not go any further.
<br>I don't know why exactly, but there seemed to be some resistance to either of us support techs moving into anything else within the
company. Seeing how this was going, I applied for a position as an L2 with a startup.

## Bigger and Better
I was now working with a more approachable stack, a monolith Ruby on Rails web app hosted on AWS, with many developers actively maintaining and improving it. It was
an entirely different experience. I was no longer responsible for the usual busy-work of moving through the OSI on every single ticket. When the L1 team couldn't figure it out, it came to
me. *And I had the source code this time*. My job was now concerned with the inner-workings of software. I was learning how to code without even realising it, and I **really** liked it.
Before long I was writing rake and util scripts in Ruby and Bash, automating work tasks via the AWS CLI.
<pre>


</pre>
A few months in, the on-shore Dev Ops engineer left the company. As they were still operating under a startup model, they decided against backfilling the position.
This was actually quite fortunate for me. They knew I had an interest in the field, and connected me to the off-shore Dev Ops team. I was now charged with initiating
deployments. The off-shore team were happy to let me contribute to the Ansible plays (Some of my own playbooks even made it into the workflow!). They were great guys,
really helpful and patient with me while I wrapped my head around CI/CD. Everything seemed to be going well for me and my career. But something wasn't right. I wasn't
spending time outside of work developing my skills and knowledge. I was moving at a snails-pace and couldn't care less. It turns out, in hindsight, I was actually depressed.

## Recalibrating
I ended up resigning. I didn't know what I wanted. I thought for a while that I'd re-train. Maybe start a business. I was pretty lost. After a few months of
piss-farting around, I decided I'd had enough. I liked coding. I liked the idea of creating my own apps. I liked deploying them, I liked how Linux worked. Why was I
searching for something new so many years into this career? I had all I needed right in front me. So I did some leetcode questions to re-activate my brain.
Then I decided making a website to blog about my learning journey would be beneficial. So here we are.

Thank you for reading this blog post. Apologies if you were expecting something more technical. That will come in the next one. Adios.
