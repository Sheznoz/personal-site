This website is primarily a blog for me to track my own development journey. I feel that learning in public is a good way to get feedback on my work from the wider community. This site also serves as a portfolio for any personal projects I have worked on. If you have any feedback please message me via [twitter](https://x.com/RileySherringt1), [discord](https://discordapp.com/users/88154340497297408), or even [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riley-sherrington-882942182)

## Who Am I?
I am an Australian living in Victoria, and have been working with computers since 2019 -- first as IT Support for a school, and more recently as an Application Support Engineer at both [Business Fitness](https://www.businessfitness.com.au/), then [Phriendly Phishing](https://www.phriendlyphishing.com/).

I have since decided that creating software solutions is where my passion lies. I am now continuously developing my skills in this area.
