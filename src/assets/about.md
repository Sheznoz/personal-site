This website is powered by [Astro](https://astro.build). It's a great framework - check it out. I also used [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) because I'm not a designer. Also the font I use is [JetBrainsMono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/). It's lovely.

I got all these lovely icons (such as in the footer) from a website called [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com). They do great work and I would highly recommend looking at their stuff.

Special thanks goes out to my brother Jordan, who helped me with a lot of the HTML and styling of this site, he is a gun. [Check out his website](https://jdsherrington.github.io) and his [github](https://github.com/jdsherrington), he's an impressive front-end developer.
